/**
 * Phase-17 stability fix — when the app is backgrounded (e.g. user opens Termux's
 * interactive terminal for `htop`) and Android changes the active default network OR
 * puts the app's network into a restricted state, OkHttp's connection pool can hold
 * onto stale sockets and the JVM's DNS negative-cache can persist a transient
 * `UnknownHostException`.
 *
 * On return to the app the next LLM request fails with `Unable to resolve host "..."`
 * even though the network is back and a fresh `nslookup` would succeed.
 *
 * Fix: register a **default-network** callback (not the more general
 * `registerNetworkCallback`, which also fires for non-default networks like a
 * simultaneously-connected cellular when on Wi-Fi). Track the last default-network
 * handle and only evict OkHttp connection pools when the handle actually changes
 * (real Wi-Fi ↔ cell handoff, or recovery after a `onLost`). Capability ticks like
 * signal-strength changes and validation-bit toggles do NOT trigger eviction; before
 * the fix those caused multiple-times-per-minute eviction storms that killed every
 * keep-alive socket and forced fresh TCP+TLS handshakes for every subsequent request.
 *
 * Registry pattern: anyone holding a long-lived OkHttp client (LLM provider singleton,
 * MCP manager, Telegram bot client, skill URL importer) can call [register] to opt in.
 * Weak refs — the monitor doesn't keep clients alive past their natural lifecycle.
