 *      decides which ones match (e.g. SSID equality), and fires [TriggerFireCallback].
 *
 * Families are stateful — they hold receiver registrations, last-known battery levels,
 * geofence client refs, etc. Construction happens once at app start; [sync] is safe to
 * call repeatedly (it diffs against the family's own state).
