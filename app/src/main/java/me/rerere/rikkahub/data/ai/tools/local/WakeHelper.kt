/**
 * Shared entry point for the "wake the screen before doing something the user can see"
 * pattern. Every interactive tool calls this before its body so headless runs (Telegram
 * bot, cron, sub-agent) don't launch activities or fire gestures against a dark screen.
 *
 * Delegates to [ScreenWaker.wakeIfOff], which already lives in WakeScreenTool.kt and is
 * idempotent (no-op when the screen is already on). Safe to call from any coroutine
 * context; never throws — the catch swallows silently. Intentionally NO `android.util.Log`
 * call here: JVM unit tests with NULL_CONTEXT reach this helper through validation paths
 * and Log.w would throw "method not mocked", masking the assertion the test is actually
 * checking. Logging during failure here would be noise anyway.
