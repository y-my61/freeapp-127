/**
 * Tiny in-memory hostname → resolved-IP cache with a fixed TTL, used by the SSH tools so a
 * workflow that SSHes to the same host every few minutes doesn't pay a fresh DNS round-trip
 * on every connect.
 *
 * Deliberately pure / Android-free so the TTL behaviour is unit-testable: the clock is
 * injectable via [nowMs]. The default [Dns] singleton wires it to [System.currentTimeMillis]
 * and registers itself with `NetworkChangeMonitor` so a Wi-Fi ↔ cell handoff drops every
 * entry (a cached IP from the old network's split-horizon DNS would be wrong on the new one).
 *
 * Only positive results are cached — a failed lookup returns null and is never stored, so a
 * transient DNS failure can't poison the cache for the full TTL window.
